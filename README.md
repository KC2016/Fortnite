### The Dataset
This is a collection of my fortnite statistics over an 80 game collection period. Data were surveyed to looking for possible conclusions when it comes to sobriety and specific statistics in game (i.e. does sobriety make me more accurate).
The data was collected by Kristian Reynolds taking pictures of his end game stats and collecting manually.

### Features:
#### Date
"Date of game over a few days."

#### Time
"Hour of day played."</br></br>

#### Placed
"Final result in game. Incosistent due to lack of game mode knowledge. 100 possible values in solos but only 25 possible values int squads."</br></br>

#### Mental State
"High meaning intoxicated off of marijuana."</br></br>

#### Eliminations
"In Battle Royale, an elimination occurs by running out of health in Solo mode, giving out after being DBNO (Downed But Not Out), or by having all active teammates entering that state simultaneously so that they cannot save each other."

#### Assists
"Aim Assist is a gameplay mechanic in Fortnite for controller players. The purpose/goal of Aim Assist is of course, to help Controller players aim better. This only applies to P.C Controller players. As of right now, the changes affect Battle Royale, Creative and Save the World"
[Source](https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Aim_Assist)
"Aim assist in a first-person shooter game is basically a feature that helps players line up shots more easily. When a player aims, the software automatically adjusts the crosshair to where the game thinks itâ€™s supposed to be."

#### Revives
"To revive downed allies, a player must stand near one, point the aiming reticule and hold down the action button for 10 seconds without being eliminated."

#### Accuracy
"If unaware, First Shot Accuracy (FSA), is a mechanic implemented in Fortnite earlier in 2018, which essentially makes your first shot 100% accurate, provided that you are not moving."

"The trick to gathering items like Wood, Metal, and Stone is to time your swings. Early on in the game, players unlock a skill that allows them to hit a critical point on any item that they swing at with their pickaxe. When hit, this critical area causes the item to decay faster."

#### Damage to Structures
"Structures are buildings constructed by players in Fortnite. Structures are Crafted from harvested Materials. While any Character may construct a Structure, Constructors do so most efficiently. Structures are useful for sheltering from Husks."
