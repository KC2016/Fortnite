## The Dataset
This is a collection of my fortnite statistics over an 80 game collection period. I am looking for possible conclusions when it comes to sobriety and specific statistics in game. (i.e. does sobriety make me more accurate). Any data analysis would be much appreciated!
The data was collected by taking pictures of my end game stats and collecting manually.
